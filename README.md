# Custom WordPress Theme - Static Version

This repository contains a static version of a WordPress theme I designed and developed for a bricklaying business. It serves as a demonstration of my original design and showcases the theme's functionality and visual style.

## Folder Structure

### `wordpress_theme` Folder -> `pointingservicemontreal` Folder
This folder contains the custom WordPress theme code, written in PHP. It incorporates Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) to provide flexible content management capabilities. The theme also uses form plugins to create tailored solutions for client needs. This theme is designed to be uploaded to a WordPress installation for full functionality.

### Static Pages
- **`index.html`**: A static version of the home page.
- **`about.html`**: A static version of the About page.

These files showcase the design and layout of the theme without requiring a WordPress environment.

## Project Timeline
**November 2024 - Present**

### Current Status
I am actively collaborating with the client to refine and implement the final product to meet their specific needs.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Requirement Gathering
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- WordPress Development
- PHP Programming

## Future Goals
- Complete the implementation of the WordPress theme for production use.
- Continuously collaborate with the client to ensure the theme fully meets their business needs.
